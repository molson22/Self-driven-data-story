        <p>Suicide has been one of the leading causes of death in the world for a while now and rates have increased over the years, the increase in social media across the world is a major cause of the problem. </p>

        <p> Social media has taken over the lives of young adults everywhere. It’s completely changed how people communicate and interact with each other. These apps have become competitive where everyone is competing for who could look the best or who could get the most likes.</p>

        

        <p>Social media has paved the way for many young adults and others to become depressed and battle with suicidal thoughts. “I have seen social media being a major cause for depression and poor mental health in kids I have talked to,” said Katie Ladner, a therapist I used to go to who works with people with mental health problems or depression. 
</p>

        <p>Ladner went on to describe the different ways social media can negatively affect someone's mental health. “Things like cyberbullying and FOMO are two of the main causes for social media making teens depressed,” she said. “Also I feel like social media causes so much stress on these kids by how hard they compare themselves to others, and by fear of not getting enough clicks or likes.”

        <p>As you can see in the graph above, which measures social media usage in minutes per day, social media usage has gone up every year from 2012-2023. </p>

        <p>The data comes from the GWI from 2012-2023. The GWI is a consumer research company that provides on-demand insights to everyone. </p>

        <p>The number the graph shows are extermely alarming. With social media usage increasing every year it is way more likely that more kids will suffer depression and suicidal thoughts from social media each year.</p>

        <p>
        As you can see in the graph above, which measures suicide rates per 100,000 for every age group in the world, Suicide rates have increased to a good extent for every age range from 1950-2018. 
</p>

        <p>The data comes from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) on February 12, 2024. The NCHS is a U.S. government agency that provides statistics on the public health of Americans to improve society. The data is from the Data.gov website which is the federal government's open data site. The Data covers the time period from 1950-2018 across the world.
</p>

        <p>The alarming thing is that the highest rate for an age group was for 15-24 year olds in 2018, which was about 612 for every 100,000 people. This should tell us something, Social media use is increasing every year, as well as suicide rates for the main users of social media. There must be a correlation. 
</p>

<p>
    To address this issue, Social media companies need to create safer online environments and kids should be taught at a young age to control their screen time and live in reality away from their screen and social media.
